Oh boy, jumping back in with a project after the Path of Exile Heist League took over my free time.

11 months later...
And then coming back again after having to prepare for school, actually going to school, and then recovering from school.

Tip(s) I learned:
I don't have to add and rip out elements if I'm just updating the text. Otherwise, it adds too much unnecessary processing.

Should I or shouldn't I make a loop if I want some code to only run twice? Decisions, decisions...
